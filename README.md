## Project Description
We are to design a maths video game phone app aimed at both children attending school and adults who 
struggle with maths. We plan to design a card game system to help teach addition, subtraction, 
multiplication and division, with the numbers getting higher as you advance through the story, 
attacking enemy ships in the process. In between main rounds, small sub-games will appear
asking the user to solve a maths problem, involving longer form questions or logic. The game will feature
AI that allows the computer players to fight back against the user, with the AI getting smarter as the game
progresses.

The game could feature multiple modes, such as a player vs player mode, or a mode more focused arround building
a deck of the cards that have been earned throughout the main story. The game should feature AI voices from
IDM to help voice some of the characters. It will be developed in Android Studio with Java.
