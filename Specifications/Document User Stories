Client at IBM

I am the client at IBM who commissioned this project. My goal is to see if there are better, more imaginative ways to teach maths after bad experiences with existing programs. I would also like to see how IBM tech services can be used in conjunction with web applications to facilitate an interactive learning experience.

Teacher

I am a teacher who is using this service. My goal is to give my students a good tool to help them develop their basic maths skills in addition to the teaching they receive in the classroom. Therefore, I would like to have a game that already assumes basic knowledge of the main concepts, and actively challenges my students at a level appropriate for them.

Parent

I am a parent using this service. My goal is to provide extra learning resources for my child outside of school. Since I only have one - a few children, I would ideally like a more personalised experience based on what they need to learn. I would like the game to be engaging like a game so that it does not feel like tedious schoolwork and also cover concepts and methods that may be difficult for me to explain.

Child

I am a child using this service. My goal is to learn more maths skills while having fun. Therefore, I would like to feel like I am playing a game while I am being appropriately challenged.
